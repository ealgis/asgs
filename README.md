# EALGIS - Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS)

(To find out what EALGIS is, see https://github.com/ealgis/ealgis/)

## Overview

This loader generates database schemas for ASGS boundaries.
When boundaries are updated, they will be added to this repository. Historical boundaries will continue to be available.

For detailed documentation about how to run this data loader, and adding new boundaries, please refer to our [Australian Electorates](https://github.com/ealgis/australian-electorates) data loader.
